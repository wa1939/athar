/**
 * A user-defined rule that materializes into a [Transaction] on a schedule.
 *
 * Athar v1 supports monthly, weekly, and yearly cadences. The pipeline runs
 * idempotently — each "due" rule produces one PENDING transaction on the user's
 * Today tray; the user confirms it like an SMS-parsed entry. Never auto-confirm,
 * since the user might want to adjust the amount or skip the month.
 *
 * Cf. ROADMAP_GLOBAL G-3: rent, salary, subscriptions, utilities.
